## Introduction

Dodge Danger is a simple 3D game under 500 KB for macOS and Windows where you dodge obstacles.

This game was developed with the following motivations:
* To create a small cross-platform game with minimal dependencies and no assets.
* To re-use and extend the backend used for my more developed game [Sky Checkers](https://github.com/zorgiepoo/Sky-Checkers).
* To provide a sample game that can be used as an introduction for searching pointers to variables using [Bit Slicer](https://github.com/zorgiepoo/Bit-Slicer).

No audio assets are used so I suggest playing music in the background.

Game contollers are supported.
